## Services offered

### [Troubleshooting and Assistance](./troubleshooting/)

When your computer is being difficult it can be hard to find the source of the problem, and even harder to form a plan of action. Whether it is hardware or software, I can help solve any problem.

### [Repairs and Upgrades](./repairsandupgrades/)

Running out of space? Performance not as good as it used to be? Whether it is a simple operating system update or replacing core components, I make it simple to pick out and perform upgrades on your existing computer.

### [New Builds](./newbuilds/)

Need a new computer but aren't satisfied by what is available to buy? You can select from a range of systems, entry-level to high-end. Alternatively, for custom builds I can help select the components, build, and then set up your computer to your exact specification, catering to almost any budget.

### [Data Recovery and Transfer](./data/)

For recovering lost data, or transferring it to a different computer.
